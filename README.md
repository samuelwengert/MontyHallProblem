# MontyHallProblem

# Description
This program simulates the Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The player is presented with three doors, behind one of which is a prize. After the player makes an initial choice, one of the remaining non-winning doors is revealed. The player then has the option to stick with their original choice or switch to the other remaining door. The program helps analyze the probabilities associated with switching vs. staying.

# How It Works
1. The program randomly selects a winning door.

2. The player makes an initial choice.

3. One of the non-winning doors is revealed.

4. The player is given the option to switch or stay.

5. The outcome is displayed based on the player's decision.

# Compilation/Execution
To compile the program, use a C++ compiler such as g++:

 g++ monty_hall.cpp -o monty_hall

Run the executable:
./monty_hall


# Dependencies
C++11 or later

Standard C++ library (iostream, random)


# Possible Enhancements
Add multiple simulation runs to calculate probabilities.

Implement a statistical analysis comparing win rates of switching vs. staying.

Improve user interaction with better prompts and error handling.
